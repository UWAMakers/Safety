# Safety Training

Safety is a core value of the UWA Makers. Remember in high school when everyone had to be able to go home after shop class? It's the exact same mentality required here.

As part of having a safe culture, it is important for our members to understand what it means to be safe. To aid this, we have developed a series of safety modules that members and visitors (who will be actively engaging with tools and projects) are required to take before starting any activities.

This repository hosts the source code of the modules and powers the training portal used to instruct students and members on safe operating procedures.
